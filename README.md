# C-Calculator
I just made this for fun, do whatever you want with it lmao

How to compile: 

Make sure CMake is installed on windows command prompt, and after that get the files in a directory

and run cmake CMakeLists.txt
After this has finished, you should have successfully made the VS solution after that go in and built it, and run the compiled exe :)
